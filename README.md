# LinkedInPostBot

## Function of the main.py script:

- Get your LinkedIn email/username and password from 'config.txt' file, which you have to set up on your own (I include it in the .gitignore).
- Open up a Chrome web page and direct to 'https://www.linkedin.com'.
- Auto Login into your LinkedIn account.
- Open the Create a Post View.
- Pass the post content in 'post.txt' file, which you have to set up on your own(I include it in the .gitignore), to the Rich Text editor.
- Make a Post and Close the web page.

- Commented Feature: Depending on your need, you can uncomment the last few lines of codes to save the screenshot of your today's post and open it for checking purpose.

## Final Thoughts updated on Day 3:

Okay, so today, I was taking a break after dinner. Somehow this "already ended" project popped into my head, and some ideas about improving this LinkedIn Post Automation project poured. And here I am. I finished the project to the status I wanted it to be initially. Hooray!

## Some Thoughts about the project on Day 2:

My initial drive of building this project is to automate my everyday LinkedIn post.
After around 3 hours of building this project, I would recommend you search for LinkedIn API resources if you want to realize the automation of your LinkedIn post and have some admin access to a LinkedIn Company Page.

Since I am an independent developer and I am okay with the present posting process(after testing my script for hours without access to LinkedIn API lol), I'd like to end this project right here.

Thanks for reading.
