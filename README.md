# LinkedInPostBot

## Function of the main.py script:

- Get your LinkedIn email/username and password from 'config.txt', which you have to set up on your own.
- Open up a Chrome web page and direct to 'https://www.linkedin.com'.
- Auto Login into your LinkedIn account and open the Create a Post View.

## Some Thoughts about the project:

My initial drive of building this project is to automate my everyday LinkedIn post.
After around 4 hours of building this project, I would recommend you search for LinkedIn API resources if you want to realize the automation of your LinkedIn post and have some admin access to a LinkedIn Company Page.

Since I am an independent developer and I am okay with the present posting process(after testing my script for hours lol), I'd like to end this project right here.

Thanks for reading.
